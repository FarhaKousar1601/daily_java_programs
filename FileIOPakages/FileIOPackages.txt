It envolve collection of classes and interfaces. To read and write from a particular file.

source.txt --> Program --> Destination.txt

Channel: Channel is a mediam for data transfer / flow. Every channel will perform read and write operation.

Stream: Stream can be defined as sequence of data. There are 2 types of Stream Channel
ie.
	(1)	byteOrientedStream Channel
	(2)	characterOrientedStream Channel

(1)byteOrientedStream Channel

To perform read and write operation with the help of byteOrientedStream channel.
It is possible ny creating objrcts.

Hence java supports 2 classes.

	i)	Input Stream
	ii)	Output Stream

The child classes have file Input as well output stream.

Both classes are regular or normal classes hence we are able to create an object.

For read operation we need to create object of fileInputStream and for write operation we need to create an object of fileOutputStream.

NOTE : It is mandatory to create source file. But not to mandatory create destination file. If we don't create destination file java will automatically create it.
